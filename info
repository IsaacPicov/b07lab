This is the first lab for b07 in which we are learning to use git, and writing a 
few functions in java. 
The code includes a polynomial class with the following methods:
1.)Add, takes on argument of type polynomial and returns the polynomial instance + polynomial arg
2.)Evaluate, takes argument of type double representing x and evaluates as follows
3.)hasRoot, takes on argument of type double and determines whether this calue is a root of the
  polynomial or not.
